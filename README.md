# PROJECT26-08-Customer_Segmentation
This project focuses on applying K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score from the well-known Mall Customers dataset. The main objective is to identify distinct customer groups that businesses can target with tailored marketing strategies. The workflow begins with data exploration and preprocessing, followed by feature scaling to normalize the income and spending data. Using the Elbow Method, the optimal number of clusters is determined, after which K-Means clustering is applied to group customers. The results are visualized through scatter plots, box plots, and count plots to highlight the unique characteristics of each cluster. The insights reveal patterns such as high-income, high-spending premium customers, low-income, budget-conscious customers, and high-income individuals with low spending who may require retention strategies. This project demonstrates how clustering techniques can help businesses better understand customer behavior, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance customer satisfaction.
